        <p>
            The most junior of baby web developers. I am currently attending Northwestern University's Coding Boot Camp Fall 2018 Cohort. 
            I have ~3 years experience of self-taught coding, mostly in Python. Most of the my time spent in Python has been used to learn 
            foundational programming skills, data structures, and develop simple games such as Tic Tac Toe, Yahtzee, a one-way version of 
            Pong, and more. I am eagerly refining my skills over the course of the boot camp with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other 
            languages/frameworks to prepare for a transition into the industry as a Developer.

            When I'm not writing code, I have many hobbies that consume my daily life. To name a few:
                <li>
                    I play Dungeons and Dragons multiple times a week, and have played for over 15 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I like to make music, mix audio, and am currently about to start recording a podcast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I play many video games. I would say my top 3 games that I'm 
                    currently playing are: World of Warcraft, DOOM, and Dragon Quest XI.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I play guitar. I own a Fender Telecaster.
                </li>
